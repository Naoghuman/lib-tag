Welcome to `Lib-Tag` with the new release `0.4.0`.

`Lib-Tag` is a library to use and handle easily [Tag]s in your a [JavaFX] & [Maven] 
application.  
A `Tag` is basically a simple [String] which can be used for example in a [Button], 
[Label] or another [JavaFX] components. Suchlike tagged topics can be easily searched 
or analysed for a `Tag`.

Written in [JavaFX] and [NetBeans IDE] the project contains several sub-libraries 
for specific tasks. For example:
* `Lib-Tag-Core`     : The sub-library contains the core functionalities from the project.
* `Lib-Tag-Component`: The sub-library allowed to show [Tag]s in different [JavaFX] gui components.
